# Part 1 (20%)

Mercedes wants to make sure you have a firm grasp on the Java programming language. They have created 10 tasks to test your knowledge.

For each task, you need to uncomment the correct portion of the commented code in order to complete the task. Read the instructions in the JavaDoc carefully for each task to understand the wanted behaviour.

# Tasks
* [Task 1](Task01.java)
* [Task 2](Task02.java)
* [Task 3](Task03.java)
* [Task 4](Task04.java)
* [Task 5](Task05.java)
* [Task 6](Task06.java)
* [Task 7](Task07.java)
* [Task 8](Task08.java)
* [Task 9](Task09.java)
* [Task 10](Task10.java)

#  Unit tests
The two first tasks in part 1 are covered by unit tests.
The unit tests are located in

* [Part1Tests](../../../../../test/java/com/mercedesbenz/part1/Part1Tests.java)

When the tests are green (running without errors), that means you have uncommented the correct answer.

You can run the unit tests by pressing the green "Play" buttons when you open the test class.
Remember that you also can make use of main methods in this part!
