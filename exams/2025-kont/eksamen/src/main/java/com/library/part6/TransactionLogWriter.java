 * Handles writing transaction logs to an output stream.

     * 2025-07-31T11:45:00;user456;ISBN978987654321;RETURN;SUCCESS

     * The stream is flushed after all transactions have been written. The underlying
     * {@code OutputStream} is not closed by this method.
     * 
     * YOU CAN ASSUME THAT THE {@code transactions} PARAMETER IS NOT NULL, BUT IT CAN BE EMPTY, AND
     * THAT THERE ARE NO NULL ELEMENTS IN THE LIST. 
     *
     * @param transactions The list of {@link TransactionRecord} objects to write.
     * @param outputStream The {@link OutputStream} to write the transaction log to.
     * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs while writing to the stream.
