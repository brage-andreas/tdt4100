# Part 1 (20%)

BMW wants to make sure you have a firm grasp on the Java programming language. They have created 10 tasks to test your knowledge.

For each task, you need to uncomment the correct portion of the commented code in order to complete the task.Read the instructions in the JavaDoc carefully for each task to understand the wanted behaviour.

You get points for each commented line where you have correctly removed the comment. The total points of the task are distributed based on how many correct answers there are in the task. If you remove a comment on a line that should not be removed, then you are deducted accordingly. You cannot get less than 0 points per task.

# Tasks
* [Task 1](Task1.java)
* [Task 2](Task2.java)
* [Task 3](Task3.java)
* [Task 4](Task4.java)
* [Task 5](Task5.java)
* [Task 6](Task6.java)
* [Task 7](Task7.java)
* [Task 8](Task8.java)
* [Task 9](Task9.java)
* [Task 10](Task10.java)

#  Unit tests
The two first tasks in part 1 are covered by unit tests.
The unit tests are located in

* [Part1Tests](../../../../../../test/java/com/bmw/manufacturing/part1/Part1Tests.java)

When the tests are green (running without errors), that means you have uncommented the correct answer.

You can run the unit tests by pressing the green "Play" button when you open the test class.
Remember that you also can make use of main methods in this part!
