     * Reads an input stream and produces a result set with a list of unique countries and encountered
     * errors by parsing the stream.
     * The input stream is expected to be a CSV file with the format 
     * as defined in resources/countries/metadata.csv
     * 
     * Behavioural requirements:
     * <ul>
     * <li>The first line of the file contains header information and should be skipped</li>
     * <li>There might be various types of errors in the file, such as missing fields, erronous data etc.
     * Oonly the country name and its 3-letter ISO country code are necessary to validate for errors</li>
     * <li>If erronous data is encountered (such as empty string), an error should be added to the result set 
     * and the line should be skipped, continuing to read the file from the next line</li>
     * <li>A list of unique countries should be returned, a countrys uniqueness is determined by 
     * its 3-letter ISO code {@link no.ntnu.tdt4100.part4.Country#equals(String)}</li>
     * <li>Each time a duplicate country is encountered, the error message should be "Duplicate country"</li>
     * <li>If parsed correctly, the returned list should be 249 elements long</li>
     * <li>The returned map of errors should contain the file line number where the error occured 
     * as key and the Exception message as value</li>
     * <li>Countries that have commas in their names are quoted with "" in the CSV (example on line 35). 
     * The {@link no.ntnu.tdt4100.part4.Country#name()} in {@link ResultSet} should not contain quotes.
     * You may use the supplied {@link MetadataReader#CSV_SPLIT_REGEX} to achieve this.</li>
